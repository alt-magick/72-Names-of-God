# 72-Names-of-God
A kabbalistic system of magic.

The name of God, also known as the name of the Angels is found in Exodus 14:19â€“21. In the original Hebrew each of the verses contains 72 letters. The passages are divided into 3 letters making 72 names, three letter each.  Some think that the creation of the world was achieved by these 216 sacred letters that form the names of God.

The 72 Names are each 3-letter sequences that act like an index to specific, spiritual frequencies. By simply looking at the letters, as well as closing your eyes and visualizing them, you can connect with these frequencies. Of course in plain text we just have the phonetic sounds.

To use a physical metaphor to describe what takes place when using the 72 Names, think of a tuning fork, a tool used to establish a precise pitch. When you bring a vibrating tuning fork close to another tuning fork that is not vibrating, the second fork starts to vibrate by the phenomena called 'sympathetic transference'.

The 72 Names work as tuning forks to repair you on the soul level. It means, practically speaking, that you don't have to go through some of the more physically demanding tests in life; you can tune your body and soul with the spiritual frequencies your eyes do not perceive.

They also connect you to spirits on the same frequencies, kind of like changing the channel on a radio.  This allows you to connect with Angels on the same frequencies! I have been doing research into this for quite some time, and I'm still researching exactly how much further we can take all of this!

Presented here are all of the 72 names of God.
